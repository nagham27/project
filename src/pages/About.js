            <p>
              One of the great things about word games is that they can be
              enjoyed by players of all ages. As language is such a critical
              part of everyday life, regardless of what you do or where you
              live, word games offer an opportunity to flex those
              language-twisting muscles in a fun and engaging way! Remember that
              while word games can certainly take on the form of more
              traditional board games or card games, they arenâ€™t restricted to
              those formats either. Did you know that there are tons of great
              Alexa word games you can play using only your voice? How awesome
              is that?
